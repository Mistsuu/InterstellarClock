# InterstellarClock
Display clock animation in the desktop background for Windows 10.
<br>
<br>**NOTE: EVEN IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 10, THE PROGRAM MIGHT NOT EVEN RUN BECAUSE OF THE BACKGROUND DETECTION MECHANISM I WROTE MAY NOT WORK IN SOME MACHINE**

# Run the program to test only
1. Click on _Download ZIP_ to download/clone the files.
2. Find the _InterstellarClock.exe_ and _config.txt_ files in the **/bin/** folder.
3. Put them in anywhere you want, but two files gotta be at the same folder so that the configuration could take effect.
4. You could leave out the _config.txt_ file, doing so will let the program runs at the default settings.
5. Run the _.exe_ file. 
6. After running, if you want to stop it, you gotta end the program in **Task Manager**, or logout, because I'm too lazy to implement the off button...

# How to set the background automatically during startup
You could create the shortcut of the program in the your machine's startup folder the logout->login to enjoy :D

# How to uninstall the background automatically during startup
Just remove the shortcut from the startup folder and u will be fine :)
